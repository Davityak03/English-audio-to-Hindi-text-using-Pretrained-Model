# English Audio to Hindi Text Using Pre-trained Models and Transformers

This project involves converting English audio into Hindi text using pre-trained models and Transformer architectures. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to transcribe English audio and then translate the transcribed text into Hindi. This is achieved using pre-trained models for both ASR and translation tasks. The notebook demonstrates how to:

1. Load and preprocess English audio files.
2. Perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert audio to text.
3. Translate the transcribed English text into Hindi using pre-trained Transformer models.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. The main dependencies are as follows:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers
- TensorFlow
- Libraries for audio processing (e.g., `librosa` or `pydub`)

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install transformers torch librosa
```

Or using a requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Process

The notebook is structured into the following key steps:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Audio:**
   - Audio files are loaded using libraries like `librosa` or `pydub`.
   - Preprocessing involves converting the audio into the correct sample rate and format for the ASR model.

2. **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):**
   - A pre-trained ASR model is employed to transcribe the English audio into text. 
   - The model converts the waveform of the audio into a sequence of characters or words in English.

3. **Translation to Hindi:**
   - The transcribed English text is fed into a pre-trained Transformer model for translation.
   - The Transformer model translates the English text into Hindi.

4. **Post-processing:**
   - The translated text may be refined to improve readability and accuracy.
   - This step could involve formatting the text, correcting any minor errors, or adjusting for contextual relevance.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - The final output is compared with reference translations, if available.
   - The quality of transcription and translation can be evaluated using metrics like BLEU score, accuracy, or manual review.

## Usage

To use the notebook:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   
   Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Launch the Jupyter Notebook in your environment:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook English_Audio_to_Hindi_Text_using_Pre_trained_model_and_Transformers.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the Steps**:

   The notebook is structured in a step-by-step manner:

   - **Loading and Preprocessing Audio**: Convert the audio file into a format suitable for ASR.
   - **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Use a pre-trained ASR model to transcribe the English audio into text.
   - **Text Translation**: Use a Transformer-based model to translate the English text into Hindi.
   - **Evaluation**: Evaluate the quality of the transcription and translation.

## Data

The notebook requires English audio files as input. Ensure that your audio files are in a supported format (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`). The quality of the transcription and translation depends on the clarity of the audio and the performance of the pre-trained models.
